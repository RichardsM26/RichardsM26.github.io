# Embarrassed 

## 11th January 2026

I don't really get embarrassed. This is good for me. There have only been two times I have been embarrassed since starting year three.

I absolutely loved the film zootropolis 2, don't know why, probaly the colours and light heartedness. However one part of the story was not as light hearted and after 3 double gin and tonics were there some tears......yes. Now after the film I realised I'd lost my headphones. This was the start of my crashout. "Im such a looser," "you guys don't understand that I am a looser," "I suck." 

This was after a term of drinking, not eating the right things and feeling unbalanced. There were some new changes to my uni life and I was just exhausted from the turbulence of it all and the headphones were the final straw. I think this is because usually after big emotional events usually I just stop caring about myself and got into survival mode. 

Anyway back the embarrassment. In the moment I was not embarrassed - I needed to let out those emotions; about being broken up with, a steep learning curve with my placement and just generally being an adult. When I get to the blog about female friendships, it will be an assay, my two frinds were amazing. 

When I woke up in the morning however I did not feel proud of my over the top outburst. I couldn't get over that I had let life get to me so much that I was using the word "loser" and "suck." That's embarrassing in itself. 

The second time this term was in front of my house mates and also my 18 year old brother. I received a message from a boy basically rejecting me after two occasions. And for some reason I started to well up and had to go into the garden. I GOT UPSET ABOUT A BOY AFTER SEEING HIM TWICE. I'm sorry I really did not like myself that night. Rob doesn't usually see me cry and he was just like. 

Thankfully now I laugh at these little titbits, and am so glad there the only times I have felt embarrassed this year. I'm not scared of embarrassing myself in front of strangers, family or friends because what are they going to do/say. "Oh wow that was embarrassing for marf." 

Don't care.
